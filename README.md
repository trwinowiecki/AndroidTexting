#Android Texting Application
This android app was designed alongside a Windows client and server. The purpose of this application is to mimic the functionality that Apple has with their iMessage on iPhone and Mac.
In it's current state it can transfer current text messages, allows the user to text from both devices and will sync the clipboard of both devices.
